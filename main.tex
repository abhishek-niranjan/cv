{\textbf{Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P) :} Bixby is a voice assistant indigenous to Samsung smart devices. As a part of \textit{Automated Speech Recognition(ASR)} team, I built Copy-Augmented Encoder-Decoder Bi-LSTM based architecture to achieve state-of-the-art results. Research paper accepted at ASRU 2019.
\vspace{4} \\ 
\textbf{Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) :} Approached the GEC problem as a sequence-2-sequence task with (hypothesis, reference) as the (source, target) sentence pair. Modified Transformer architecture to handle attention from multi Encoders in an hierarchical fashion for on-device textual processing module in smartphones to assist voice and keyboard enabled services.
\vspace{4} \\ 
\textbf{Speech-to-Speech Translation :} Presently working on translation problem involving conversion of Korean audio signal features to English audio signal features. Using Transformer model as the fundamental sequence-to-sequence architecture with addition of auxiliary decoders to train on parallel tri-phone aligned data.\\}
\vspace{-2mm}
\cventry{May-Jul 2017}{Data Science Intern}{Amplus Solar}{Gurgaon, India}{}
{\textbf{Soiling Rate :} Photovoltaic plants experience soiling phenomena which results in decrement of power generation. Developed an algorithm to compute the soiling rate from limited data to devise a \textit{cost-optimized} cleaning schedule of solar plants.
\vspace{4} \\ 
\textbf{Power-Generation Forecasts : }Engineered a forecasting module to predict hourly active power generation by a PV plant using \textit{gradient boosted trees}. achieving a correlation of 0.97; Augmented the feature set by utilizing OpenWeatherMap API.
\vspace{4} \\ 
\textbf{Power-BI Reports : }Automated the generation of daily visualization reports of Solar Plants portfolio in \textit{Power BI} by connecting MySQL server hosted on AWS EC2 instance. Built a GUI application using \textit{PyQt}4 to facilitate the data downloading from multiple dashboards. \\
}

\cventry{May-Jul 2016}{Data Science Intern}{Bidgely Technologies}{Bangalore, India}{}
{\textbf{Vacation Detection : }Bidgely's energy dis-aggregation technology helps consumers and utilities to adopt eco and pocket friendly power consumption. Devised a sliding window algorithm to predict the vacation instances of the residents in \textit{MATLAB with precision \textgreater95\% and recall \textgreater70\%,} which got incorporated into production.
\vspace{4} \\ 
\textbf{Refrigeration Consumption : }Extended the sliding-window algorithm to compute refrigerator consumption from low resolution energy data, which was pushed into dis-aggregation pipeline. \\}

\subsection{Academic}
\cventry{Jul 2017 -- May 2018}{Researcher}{Complex Networks Research Group}{Indian Institute of Technology}{Kharagpur, India}
{\textit{Advised by } Prof. Pawan Goyal and Prof. Mayank Singh\\
\textbf{Master's Thesis: Document Clustering -} Aim of the project was to cluster articles from ACL Anthology on the basis of NLP tasks and the methodology (algorithm, deep architecture, etc.) proposed to solve that task. 
Labelled the research articles with one of the NLP tasks (Machine Translation, NER, etc.) using rule-based pattern search in bibliographic text (title, abstract and citations received and given) to formulate a semi-supervised learning problem of tagging research papers with the NLP task. Created the feature-set comprising of learned vector embeddings of research articlesâ€™ bibliographic text(doc2vec) and citation network features for each of the rule-based tagged research article. The algorithm achieved \textit{recall of 91.52\%} and \textit{precision of 76.31\%}. \\}
\vspace{-2mm}
\cventry{Jul 2017 -- Apr 2018}{Teaching Assistant}{Indian Institute of Technology}{Kharagpur, India}{}
{\textit{Programming and Data Structures} for Prof. Rogers Mathew.\\
Tutored freshmen in data structures concepts and algorithmic programming exercises.\\}
\vspace{-2mm}
\cventry{Jan 2017 -- May 2017}{Undergraduate Researcher}{Complex Networks Research Group}{Indian Institute of Technology}{Kharagpur, India}
{\textbf{Bachelor's Thesis:Copying Citation Contexts -}  Objective of the project was to analyze massive dataset comprising of nearly 1.5 million computer science articles and more than 26 million citation contexts to understand the behaviour of "Copying Citation Contexts" amongst the researchers. Conducted experiments to reveal the copying patterns across 24 fields of computer science as well as the prominence of self-citation (authors citing their previous work) in the research community. Research Paper published in \textit{Joint Conference on Digital Libraries(JCDL), 2017}}
